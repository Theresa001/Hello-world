# Hello-world
A platform that enables a great teamwork among its members


Hello everyone, 
My name is Theresa and I am a UI/UX designer. 
It all started last year November when I all hope was lost about getting a job, I saw a boot camp link on front-end, UI/UX  and others. I was about to pay when a friend of mine told me to learn on my own. Two weeks later, I was able to design and prototype a mobile food app. I am so glad I am part of HNGi7.
In essence, believe in yourself first and build yourself through HNGi7. 
I look forward to meeting everyone.
Thank you.
